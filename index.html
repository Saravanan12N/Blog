           <h2>Tamil Language</h2> 
            Tamil[c] (தமிழ், Tamiḻ, pronounced [t̪amiɻ] ⓘ) is a Dravidian language natively spoken by the Tamil people
            of South Asia. Tamil is an official language of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and union territory of
            Puducherry, and the sovereign nations of Sri Lanka and Singapore.[9][5] Tamil is also spoken by significant
            minorities in the four other South Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and the
            Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is also spoken by the Tamil diaspora found in many
            countries, including Malaysia, Myanmar, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New
            Zealand, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy, Indonesia, and Mauritius. Tamil is also
            natively spoken by the Sri Lankan Moors. One of 22 scheduled languages in the Constitution of India, Tamil
            was the first to be classified as a classical language of India.
</p><p>
            Tamil is one of the longest-surviving classical languages in the world.[10][11] A. K. Ramanujan described it
            as "the only language of contemporary India which is recognizably continuous with a classical past".[12] The
            variety and quality of classical Tamil literature has led to it being described as "one of the great
            classical traditions and literatures of the world".[13] Recorded Tamil literature has been documented for
            over 2000 years.[14] The earliest period of Tamil literature, Sangam literature, is dated from c. 300 BC
            until AD 300.[15][16] It has the oldest extant literature among Dravidian languages. The earliest epigraphic
            records found on rock edicts and 'hero stones' date from around the 3rd century BC.[17][18] About 60,000 of
            the approximately 100,000 inscriptions found by the Archaeological Survey of India in India are in Tamil
            Nadu. Of them, most are in Tamil, with only about 5 percent in other languages.[19] Tamil language
            inscriptions written in Brahmi script have been discovered in Sri Lanka and on trade goods in Thailand and
            Egypt.[20][21] The two earliest manuscripts from India,[22][23] acknowledged and registered by the UNESCO
            Memory of the World register in 1997 and 2005, were written in Tamil.[24]

            <blockquote class="quote"> 1578, Portuguese Christian missionaries published a Tamil prayer book in old Tamil script named Thambiran
            Vanakkam, thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published.[25] The Tamil Lexicon,
            published by the University of Madras, was one of the earliest dictionaries published in Indian
            languages.[26] According to a 2001 survey, there were 1,863 newspapers published in Tamil, of which 353 were
            dailies.[27]</blockquote>

            <h2>Classification</h2>

            Tamil belongs to the southern branch of the Dravidian languages, a family of around 26 languages native to the Indian subcontinent.[28] It is also classified as being part of a Tamil language family that, alongside Tamil proper, includes the languages of about 35 ethno-linguistic groups[29] such as the Irula and Yerukula languages (see SIL Ethnologue).

The closest major relative of Tamil is Malayalam; the two began diverging around the 9th century AD.[30] Although many of the differences between Tamil and Malayalam demonstrate a pre-historic split of the western dialect,[31] the process of separation into a distinct language, Malayalam, was not completed until sometime in the 13th or 14th century.[32]

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
            Tamil, like other Dravidian languages, ultimately descends from the Proto-Dravidian language, which was most
            likely spoken around the third millennium BC, possibly in the region around the lower Godavari river basin.
            The material evidence suggests that the speakers of Proto-Dravidian were of the culture associated with the
            Neolithic complexes of South India.[33]
</p><p>
            Among Indian languages, Tamil has the most ancient non-Sanskritic Indian literature.[34] Scholars categorise
            the attested history of the language into three periods: Old Tamil (300 BC–AD 700), Middle Tamil (700–1600)
            and Modern Tamil (1600–present).[35] In November 2007, an excavation at Quseir-al-Qadim revealed Egyptian
            pottery dating back to first century BC with ancient Tamil Brahmi inscriptions.[20] There are a number of
            apparent Tamil loanwords in Biblical Hebrew dating to before 500 BC, the oldest attestation of the
            language.[36] John Guy states that Tamil was the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India.[37]

            In 2004, a number of skeletons were found buried in earthenware urns dating from at least 696 BC in
            Adichanallur. Some of these urns contained writing in Tamil Brahmi script, and some contained skeletons of
            Tamil origin.[38]

            Between 2017 and 2018, 5,820 artifacts have been found in Keezhadi. These were sent to Beta Analytic in
            Miami, Florida for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dating. One sample containing Tamil-Brahmi
            inscriptions was claimed to be dated to around 580 BC
</p><p>
            The earliest extant Tamil literary works and their commentaries celebrate the Pandiyan Kings for the
            organization of long-termed Tamil Sangams, which researched, developed and made amendments in Tamil
            language. Even though the name of the language which was developed by these Tamil Sangams is mentioned as
            Tamil, the period when the name "Tamil" came to be applied to the language is unclear, as is the precise
            etymology of the name. The earliest attested use of the name is found in Tholkappiyam, which is dated as
            early as late 2nd century BC.[46][47] The Hathigumpha inscription, inscribed around a similar time period
            (150 BCE), by Kharavela, the Jain king of Kalinga, also refers to a Tamira Samghatta (Tamil confederacy)[48]
</p><p>
            The Samavayanga Sutra dated to the 3rd century BC contains a reference to a Tamil script named 'Damili'.[49]

            Southworth suggests that the name comes from tam-miḻ > tam-iḻ "self-speak", or "our own speech".[50] Kamil
            Zvelebil suggests an etymology of tam-iḻ, with tam meaning "self" or "one's self", and "-iḻ" having the
            connotation of "unfolding sound". Alternatively, he suggests a derivation of tamiḻ < tam-iḻ < *tav-iḻ <
                *tak-iḻ, meaning in origin "the proper process (of speaking)" .[51] However, this is deemed unlikely by
                Southworth due to the contemporary use of the compound 'centamiḻ' , which means refined speech in the
                earliest literature.[50] The Tamil Lexicon of University of Madras defines the word "Tamil"
                as "sweetness" .[52] S. V. Subramanian suggests the meaning "sweet sound" , from tam — "sweet" and il
                — "sound" .[53] </p>
